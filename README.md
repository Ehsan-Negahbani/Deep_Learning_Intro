# Deep_Learning_Intro
Deep learning using Keras
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses Keras to build a deeplearning neural network for predictive modeling.
The data is also included in the repository.
The goal is to predict if a csutomer will buy a bike or not based on some demographic and other features.
The notebook shows how to tune the model to improve the model accuracy.
The Notebook is **adopted** from a Udemy course on deep learning using Keras by Mike West
